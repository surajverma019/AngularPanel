    I swear angular-material is the worst "framework" I ever had to work with. Why does one use a monster like this when you have to add custom style definitions to have basic functionality is truely beyond me. Might as well just write your own css to begin with. At least it will do what you want and you won't have to consult anyone but your own creativity. – user2312578 Apr 13 '17 at 18:19

Although your comment is about a year old, I found it to be valid to this day. I just tried to setup a simple website skeleton consisting of a toolbar, a sidenav and the main content area, each scrollable on their own. I'm working on this for solid 4 hours now, simply because I have to tweak each element separately and AngularMaterial messes up every single UI element I add in some weird way. After coming back 3 times, saying "this time you'll get it" to myself, I'm done. Screw Angular (Material), seriously. I tried to learn this "intuitive API" several times really hard, but I'm done now. – GxTruth Feb 11 '18 at 20:57
